HarvardX's Data Analysis for the Life Sciences Certificate Program

This repository contains code written to answer questions on HarvardX's Data Analysis for the Life Sciences Program. This program builds up intuition for basic statistical concepts and linear algebra using the programming language R and the IDE RStudio. From there, courses focus on more complex data analysis techniques, including analysis of high-throughput and high-dimensional data. The analysis tool Bioconductor is then introduced and used in the analysis of genomic data. The courses are as follows: 

1. R and Statistics
2. Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra
3. Statistical Inference and Modeling for High-Throughput Experiments
4. High-Dimensional Data Analysis
5. Introduction to Bioconductor
6. Case Studies in Functional Genomics
7. Advanced Bioconductor
